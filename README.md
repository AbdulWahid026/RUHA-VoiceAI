**Description:**
In this project, I developed RUHA Voice AI, an innovative application capable of detecting prompts from voice recordings using machine learning models and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features. The RUHA Voice AI system utilizes advanced signal processing techniques to extract MFCC features from audio inputs, which are then fed into machine learning algorithms for prompt detection. Leveraging the Flask framework, I created a user-friendly front end that allows users to interact with the RUHA Voice AI system seamlessly. The front end provides an intuitive interface for uploading voice recordings, initiating prompt detection, and viewing the results in real-time. By combining MFCC features with state-of-the-art machine learning models and a responsive web interface, the RUHA Voice AI project enables efficient and accurate prompt detection, catering to a wide range of applications including voice-based assistance.
